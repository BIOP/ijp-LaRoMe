# LaRoMe

## What a strange name ! 
LaRoME = Label + Region Of Interest + Measure

**Label image** (aka Count Masks): An image in which pixels of an object have all the same value. Each object has a unique value.
 
**Measurement image**: An image in which pixels of an object have all the same value, corresponding to a measurement (Area, Angle, Mean...) 

## Installation

You can install LaRoMe via the PTBIOP update site.

Help>Update..., Manage Update Sites, select PTBIOP in the list (cf image below), Apply changes, Restart Fiji.

## run("Label image to ROIs")

From a **Label Image**(ยง), generate ROIs and add them to the ImageJ ROI Manager.

Macro Language, you can use ```run("Label image to ROIs");``` as in the example code below : 
```
if (nImages>0) run("Label image to ROIs");
```

## run("ROIs to Label image", "")

From an **Image** and some **ROIs**, generates a **Label Image**.

Macro Language, you can use ```run("ROIs to Label image");``` as in the example code below :  
```
if ((nImages>0)&&( roiManager("count") > 0)) run("ROIs to Label image");
else if (roiManager("count") == 0) print("No existing ROIs to make Label Image");
else if (nImages==0) print("No open image to use as template for dimensions");
```

## run("ROIs to Measurement Image", "column_name=Area");

From an **Image**, some **ROIs** and a selected **Measurement** generates a **Measurement Image**.
<img src="https://github.com/BIOP/ijp-LaRoMe/raw/master/images/ROIs_to_Measurement_Image.png" title="ROIsto Measurement Image.png" width="75%" align="center">

Measurement list encompass (change column_name ) : 
"Area", "Angle", "AngleVert","AR", "Circ.", "Major","Minor","Mean","Median","Mode","Min","Max", "Perim."

**Angle** measure is based on horizontal, the **AngleVert** measure is based on vertical (substracting 90 )
 
**AR**, Aspect Ratio = Major / Minor

**Circ.**, Aspect Ratio = 4 * PI * Area / Perim.^2


Macro Language, you can use ```run("ROIs to Measurement Image";``` as in the example code below: 

``` run("ROIs to Measurement Image" , "column_name=Area pattern=[]"); ```


With the lastest version (0.2) you can now use the ROI name with the option Pattern to define label (application for tracking or 3D-objects).
